              Baseball is not exactly a popular sport in Israel, and few
              Israelis have embraced it. But when the Israeli baseball team
              qualified for the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021, some
              Israelis tuned in and cheered on its players, most of whom were
              Americans with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

              Their quest for a medal — gold, silver or bronze — unfolds in
              Israel Swings for Gold, a well-crafted documentary by Seth Kramer,
              Daniel Miller and Jeremy Newberger which opens in theatres in
              Florida on May 5. Interestingly enough, much of the footage was
              shot by the players themselves because the media was not allowed
              into the Olympic Village during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is
              a sequel to Heading Home, which documented the exploits of
              Israel’s baseball squad at the 2017 World Baseball Classic in
              Seoul, South Korea. At the Olympics, Israel, the lowest-ranking
              team, faced five opponents — the United States, Japan, South
              Korea, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. “We were the Jamaican
              bobsled team of baseball,” says one of the Israelis ruefully but
              realistically. They faced political hostility at their training
              games in the United States. Palestinian women chanted, “Free, free
              Palestine” and “Long live Palestine.” Anti-Zionist haredim held
              aloft anti-Israel placards. One protester likened Israel to an
              apartheid state. Security was tight at the Olympic Village, but
              the team had no compunction in displaying the blue-and-white
              Israeli flag on the balcony of its living quarters. At the opening
              ceremony, a moment of silence was observed for the 11 Israeli
              athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, and the
              players from Israel were clearly touched by this gesture. Yet they
              encountered animosity. Some received death threats. Still others
              were rebuffed when they sought to exchange athletic pins with some
              athletes from certain nations. The film focuses on the games in
              which the Israelis appeared. Much to their disappointment, they
              won only one game. “When you lose, that’s tough,” says one of the
              players. But at least they moved into the elimination round, which
              was no small achievement, and enjoyed the privilege of
              participating in the Olympics. Unfortunately, they will not get a
              second chance to prove themselves on the field. Baseball has been
              eliminated from the 2024 Olympics, having been replaced by
              breakdancing.

              Chelsea have appointed former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino
              as their new head coach on a two-year deal, with the option of a
              further year, from July 1. The 51-year-old Argentine, who returns
              to the Premier League following previous spells in charge of
              Tottenham and Southampton, permanently succeeds Graham Potter, who
              was dismissed at the start of April after less than seven months
              in charge.Frank Lampard, who led Chelsea on a caretaker basis
              until the end of the season following Potter's sacking, has left
              the club. Jesus Perez, Miguel d'Agostino, Toni Jimenez and
              Sebastiano Pochettino will form part of Pochettino's coaching
              staff at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's co-sporting directors Laurence

              standards of excellence, leadership qualities and character will
              serve Chelsea Football Club well as we move forward. "He is a
              winning coach, who has worked at the highest levels, in multiple
              leagues and languages. His ethos, tactical approach and commitment

              Almost a year since the Austrian has not changed his stance. The
              Milton-Keynes-based outfit has nailed the RB19. As a consequence,
              nobody is fast enough to catch them. Naturally, many have written
              the 2023 season off. In light of this frustrating reality, ideas
              are being pushed to introduce regulations that balance out the
              performance of cars. Mercedes are a country mile behind the Bulls
              currently. Even with their revised W14 upgrades at Monaco, the
              team are still quite some way off a championship bid. You’d
              imagine Wolff to be in favor of a rule change that will bring them
              closer to Max Verstappen & Co. But he thinks otherwise. When
              quizzed about such a measure to be adopted, Wolff responded, “If
              we start balancing performance, we will ruin this sport,” as
              quoted by Motorsport Week. He then went on to explain his stance,
              and along the way took a subtle dig at Red Bull’s past
              misdemeanors. “This is a class of its own, the best driver in the
              best car, spending the same amount of money (as the other teams,
              ed.), and winning the championship. If you break the rules, you
              must be severely punished. Only then, but not for doing a good
              job.” Wolff seems happy where he and his team are right now. But
              he does have his eyes firmly set on catching them up eventually.
              Mercedes will be eagerly awaiting an opportunity to get back to
              their glory days and dominant ways. But the Austrian team
              principal is wary of the constraints of this sport, development
              wise. Hence, he has set himself a cautious deadline to get back to
              the top again. According to Crash.net, Wolff said, “I think the
              length [of time before catching Red Bull] is probably between six
              and 12 months. That’s the time that it really took for us [last
              year] to figure out what was actually happening with the car.”

              In a press release Friday, the track revealed the cancelation of
              races from June 7 through July 3 while nationwide experts conduct
              a "top-to-bottom review" of safety protocols. "The team at
              Churchill Downs takes great pride in our commitment to safety and
              strives to set the highest standard in racing, consistently going
              above and beyond regulations and policies that are required," said
              track CEO Bill Carstanjen. "What has happened at our track is
              deeply upsetting and absolutely unacceptable." Several horses had
              to be scratched or euthanized over a 10-day period leading up to
              the Kentucky Derby, drawing criticism aimed at Churchill Downs. An
              internal review and investigation by the Kentucky Horse Racing
              Commission found no conclusive reason behind the tragic events in
              May, creating the need for a more thorough sweep. Unfortunately,
              injuries are part of horse racing, oftentimes leading to
              heartbreaking results. However, the series of painful events at
              Churchill Downs last month can't go unresolved for the sake of the
              legendary track and the sport as a whole. Hopefully, in time, the
              horse racing world will have some answers.

              The Blackhawks won the right to draft Connor Bedard in this year’s
              draft. The team will be in rebuild mode, but there should be some
              extra excitement around the team as they are expected to have a
              generational talent on the ice next season. With the Blackhawks
              choosing not to re-sign Jonathan Toews this offseason, it would
              have been cool to see the team bring Patrick Kane back this season
              to pass his knowledge of the game to the next franchise hero.
              According to a report by ESPN, Kane is expected to miss the next
              4-6 months after undergoing hip resurfacing surgery. Kane is a
              free agent this offseason, and his agent, Pat Brisson, said Kane
              expects to “play for a long time.” Patrick Kane has ‘zero
              interest’ in the Blackhawks On Thursday, David Kaplan with ESPN
              1000 dropped another nugget about Kane’s intentions for his hockey
              future. While Kane wants to play for a long time, that won’t
              happen in Chicago. “[Kane has] zero interest in returning to the
              Blackhawks to finish out his career here,” Kaplan said sources are
              telling him. Understandably, Kane would want to play for a
              contender to try and finish his career with winning another
              Stanley Cup. However, many Blackhawks fans, myself included, would
              have liked to see Kane mentor the young Bedard as the team returns
              to prominence in the NHL.

              The Giants may have found their return specialist at OTAs
            </h1>
            <h3 class="blog__subtitle" id="subtitle">
              The New York Giants' special teams unit ranked near the bottom of
              the NFL last season, averaging just 21.4 yards per kick return and
              6.2 yards per punt return, respectively. The Giants tested out a
              number of different return specialists last season, including
              starting CB Adoree' Jackson.

              Jackson suffered a season-ending injury while returning a punt in
              Week 11. Putting a defensive starter out on special teams had
              severe adverse effects on the team as a whole. In order to avoid
              making this mistake again, the Giants should consider adding a
              designated return specialist to their roster. In-house WR Kalil
              Pimpleton looks like he could be in a position to take on the role
              after turning heads at OTAs this spring. The second-year receiver
              out of Central Michigan spent the 2022 season on New York's
              practice squad after going undrafted last spring. This summer,
              Pimpleton could use his return skills to earn himself a promotion
              to the regular-season roster. Pimpleton earned the Mid-American
              Conference Special Teams Player of the Year award for his return
              work in 2021 at Central Michigan. He ran back 16 punts for 304
              yards and two touchdowns as a redshirt junior that year. Despite
              demonstrating obvious talent as a punt returner in college,
              Pimpleton was kept on the practice squad to develop last season.
              This year at OTAs, he looked like a new and improved player,
              making an impact as a receiver during team drills. He caught a
              touchdown reception on a pass from Tyrod Taylor and hauled in a
              deep, over-the-shoulder grab from Daniel Jones at OTA No. 5. The
              Giants have put a bunch of players in the mix for their wide-open
              returner position. Jackson has taken reps as a returner again at
              OTAs, along with rookie WR Jalin Hyatt (who does not have any
              special team experience). “We’ll put as many guys back there as we
              can to figure that one out,” head coach Brian Daboll told the New
              York Post when asked about the competition at punt return
              specialist. New York has a competition brewing for the return
              specialist position. While Pimpleton may not stand out as a top
              receiver on the roster, his dynamic ability to break tackles and
              extensive history of returning punts in college could give him an
              opportunity to take the starting job. Ultimately, it will be down
              to whether or not Pimpleton can expand his impact on Sundays. The
              Giants have a solid group in their receiver room. Pimpleton will
              need to prove that he can make plays on offense, too, if he wants
              to secure a spot on the final roster.
