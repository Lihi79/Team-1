              one person/business isn't always going to work for another, and

              Investing—everything is on you. I own every decision, which is
              both empowering and stressful. Over the past few months, I've
              found it useful to type up a simple one-line mission statement:
              Make investing (and personal finance) easy. If my answer or
              solution to a problem helps drive that mission, then I know I am
              on the right track. It helps keep the stress down with all these
              daily decisions! "If you're running your own business, my other
              piece of advice would be to just keep going. Just Start Investing
              is nowhere close to where I want it to be, and sometimes the
              amount of work that needs to get done can be daunting. But I just
              keep chipping away, every day, because it's fun and I want to see

              sometimes give you whiplash. It's been important to learn how to
              step back, ignore what other businesses are doing, and evaluate
              our progress. What is working? What isn't? What does the audience
              think? Then I make choices based on what I'm actively seeing,

              Biggest lesson/challenge: "One major factor in our success is the
              fact that I was extremely cognizant of our profit margin for a
              long, long time. Most independent advisors have profit margins
              around 30%, but until last year we were consistently at 80% or
              90%. Staying lean has allowed me to be really flexible and forced
              me to be innovative. It also has allowed me to build a solid
              foundation for my personal finances, so that now, as we look to
              reinvest more in the business and know that our profit margin will
              start dropping (at least to some degree) as we hire and scale, I
              feel confident that we can truly afford to take those risks that
              are necessary to get the business to the next level. It's much
              more of a calculated risk because we're not putting ourselves in a
              do-or-die situation, and that allows for clearer thinking and less
              emotional/irrational decision-making.

              The AI craze is in full effect so everyone is trying to figure out
              who the winners will be. Maybe it will be the upstarts, some new
              start-up that gives you your own personal assistant in your ear,
              on your iPhone and at your desk. Or maybe it will be the big tech
              players who have gobs of money to throw at AI like Microsoft,
              Google and Facebook. Maybe it’s a company like NVIDIA that
              supplies the chips and software. As the old saying goes: don’t dig
              for the gold, sell the picks and shovels.1 I’m sure there are
              plenty of people out there with all kinds of useful and useless
              strategies for picking the winners in this space. My stance on
              this subject is that it‘s hard to pick the winners. That may sound
              like a copout but it’s the truth. There was a story in Bloomberg
              this week about how Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund missed out2 on the
              mammoth gains in NVIDIA this year: Cathie Wood’s flagship
              exchange-traded fund closed out its Nvidia Corp. stake in early
              January. Then, came the artificial intelligence frenzy that sent
              the stock and its big tech peers on a tear. The chipmaker has
              added around $560 billion in market capitalization since Wood
              dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion of that surge
              coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings. Although
              Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors
              in the flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been
              left out of this year’s blistering 159.90% rally. In February,
              when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward
              earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.” A lot of people
              dunked on this news because an innovation fund missed out on one
              of the biggest beneficiaries of the highest innovation potential
              we’ve seen in years. My takeaway from this is how difficult it can
              be to spot these trends in advance. Every tech person on the
              planet has been pushing crypto, Web3 and the metaverse incessantly
              for the past 3-4 years. Then ChatGPT seemingly comes out of
              nowhere, gets 100+ million users and AI takes the tech world by
              storm. Out of all the innovations we’ve been beaten over the head
              with during this cycle, no one was really talking about the
              potential for AI yet here we are. This stuff is not easy. So
              what’s my strategy? I prefer to let the indexes pick the winners
              for me. Sure, that’s boring and it’s not going to get me rich
              overnight but I have time. And I know for sure that the biggest
              winners from AI are eventually going to find their way to the top.
