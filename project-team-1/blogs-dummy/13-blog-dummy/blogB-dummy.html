              also think a big key is to not look at what others are doing or

              one person/business isn't always going to work for another, and

              “Will Ruin the Sport”: Toto Wolff Subtly Insults Red Bull for Past
              Crimes Despite Siding With Max Verstappen & Co. Over Major Change
            </h1>
            <h3 class="blog__subtitle" id="subtitle">
              In an ideal world, Red Bull would’ve been basking in the glory of
              their dominant run in the sport. To some extent, it’s safe to safe
              that they are, too. However, a dark cloud in the shape of their
              cost cap breach reprimand hangs over all their accolades. When the
              news had initially come out, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff made a huge
              hue and cry about it.

              Almost a year since the Austrian has not changed his stance. The
              Milton-Keynes-based outfit has nailed the RB19. As a consequence,
              nobody is fast enough to catch them. Naturally, many have written
              the 2023 season off. In light of this frustrating reality, ideas
              are being pushed to introduce regulations that balance out the
              performance of cars. Mercedes are a country mile behind the Bulls
              currently. Even with their revised W14 upgrades at Monaco, the
              team are still quite some way off a championship bid. You’d
              imagine Wolff to be in favor of a rule change that will bring them
              closer to Max Verstappen & Co. But he thinks otherwise. When
              quizzed about such a measure to be adopted, Wolff responded, “If
              we start balancing performance, we will ruin this sport,” as
              quoted by Motorsport Week. He then went on to explain his stance,
              and along the way took a subtle dig at Red Bull’s past
              misdemeanors. “This is a class of its own, the best driver in the
              best car, spending the same amount of money (as the other teams,
              ed.), and winning the championship. If you break the rules, you
              must be severely punished. Only then, but not for doing a good
              job.” Wolff seems happy where he and his team are right now. But
              he does have his eyes firmly set on catching them up eventually.
              Mercedes will be eagerly awaiting an opportunity to get back to
              their glory days and dominant ways. But the Austrian team
              principal is wary of the constraints of this sport, development
              wise. Hence, he has set himself a cautious deadline to get back to
              the top again. According to Crash.net, Wolff said, “I think the
              length [of time before catching Red Bull] is probably between six
              and 12 months. That’s the time that it really took for us [last
              year] to figure out what was actually happening with the car.”
