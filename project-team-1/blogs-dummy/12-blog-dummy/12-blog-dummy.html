              If you want to live a healthy life, you need to be cognizant of
              your health issues. For that, you visit a doctor to get a proper
              consultation and treatment face to face. As the time is changing,
              new innovations have taken up the place of traditional methods
              where almost everything has come online and reduced our efforts,
              time and money such as online doctor consultation. This service
              has enabled people to take online treatment through a video call
              without visiting a doctor. There are many platforms that are
              offering such services where people can enroll and get online
              doctor consultation and prescription in a quick and simple way.
              Almost every country has accepted such innovation which is saving
              people’s time and helping them to get treated online within the
              comfort of their home. Such technology is bridging the gap between
              the doctors and patients where they do not need to go one’s place
              for treatment. In Australia, many people are taking advantage of
              online consultation. They are aware of their health and due to
              having less time; they prefer to consult with an online doctor and
              share prescription in Australia which is a simple way to take
              proper treatment. In addition to this, doctor consultation fee in
              Australia is very cheap and handy which incurring patients to use
              such services. With the help of online medication, now you don’t
              need to stand in a queue for appointments. However, you can
              schedule your appointments through online consultation which is a
              convenient & quick way to approach the doctors. There are some
              introverted- shy people in the world who afraid of talking to
              doctors and share their illness. Such a platform enables people to
              talk to their doctors in private through video-calling and
              provides maximum privacy while consulting with a doctor. You will
              need to share some personal details about yourself so that the
              doctor could get an idea about your health and provide accurate
              solutions accordingly.

              1. Prep your skin with a barrier cream “Chlorine is added to
              swimming pools to disinfect and prevent the rise and spread of
              bacterial, viral and protozoan diseases,” explains Dr. Estee
              Williams, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. “Due
              to its caustic nature, chlorine is a cause of irritant contact
              dermatitis, namely red, dry, itchy skin.” To avoid that
              uncomfortable itch and redness, Williams recommends prepping your
              skin with a barrier cream before getting in the pool. Look for
              products with glycerin, oils or petrolatum listed on the
              ingredients. Bonus if it contains dimethicone, which forms a seal
              between the chlorine and your delicate skin. Note: Not all pools
              allow moisturizers to be worn by swimmers, as they may interfere
              with the disinfecting chemicals. Check the rules before lathering
              up. Try: La Roche-Posay Lipikar Balm AP+ Intense Repair
              Moisturizing Cream 2. Shower and moisturize immediately post-swim
              You already know you usually need to rinse off before entering the
              pool, per the listed rules. But if you wait until you get home to
              shower after a swim, you’re doing your skin a disservice. “Rinse
              off right after!” cautions Dr. Kristina Goldenberg,
              board-certified dermatologist in New York City. “Do not let the
              chlorinated water sit on the skin for a long period of time,” she
              warns. Warm-to-cool, clean water is best to avoid additional
              dryness. In the locker room, you may also use a mild and hydrating
              cleanser or body wash to start to restore the skin’s pH balance
              from the pool chemicals, per the American Academy of Dermatology.
              After rinsing off, reapply a moisturizer to restore hydration to
              the skin, Goldenberg recommends. Try: Sol de Janeiro Brazilian 4
              Play Moisturizing Shower Cream-Gel 3. Don’t air dry! After a cool
              dip, you may be tempted to just lie on your towel and let the sun
              dry you off. That’s not the best idea, Goldenberg cautions. “There
              is a misconception that air-drying is beneficial for the skin, but
              that’s simply not the case. Air-drying will lead to more dryness
              of the skin,” she says. She recommends rinsing off with clean
              water (see above) and then drying yourself with a cotton towel
              instead. After that, it’s time to get back to sunning—after
              applying more SPF, of course. Try: Coola SPF 30 Body Classic
              Sunscreen 4. Keep the moisturizer coming If your skin is still
              feeling dry/flaky after you get home from the pool, switch to a
              thicker moisturizer or ointment. “Remember, lotions are not as
              hydrating as creams, and creams are not as hydrating as
              ointments,” Goldenberg says. “What works for one person may not
              work for you.” Williams echoes the suggestion for an ointment
              after a long day in the sun and pool. “Apply a thick emollient
              (ointment) to the skin from the neck down before going to bed,”
              she suggests. Try: Emuaid First Aid Ointment 5. Don’t forget your
              face Luckily, swimming doesn’t usually lead to breakouts on your
              face. However, it may be as dry and irritating for the face as for
              the rest of your body, notes Goldenberg. “Hydration before and
              after swimming is key,” she says. “And remember to rinse your face
              right after the pool, too!”

              Screening tests, such as Pap smears or blood pressure checks,
              could save your life. They can detect a disease you have no reason
              to suspect is there. Early detection may allow treatment while a
              health condition is curable and before irreversible complications
              arise. Some screening tests help prevent the disease they are
              designed to detect. For example, colonoscopies and Pap smears can
              identify precancerous abnormalities that can be addressed so they
              cannot continue to grow and become cancerous. And missed screening
              tests contribute to thousands of avoidable deaths each year in the
              US. Yet there's a point of diminishing returns, as a new study on
              Pap smears illustrates. And many of us could benefit from a better
              understanding of the limits of screening, and how experts decide
              when people should stop routine screening tests. Know the limits
              of screening tests Even the best screening test has limitations.
              It can miss the disease it's intended to detect (false-negative
              results). Or it can return abnormal results when no disease is
              present (false-positive results). Equally important, as people
              grow older life expectancy declines and screening benefits tend to
              wane. Many conditions detected by routine screenings, such as
              prostate cancer or cervical cancer, typically take a while to
              cause trouble. A person in their 80s is more likely to die from
              another fatal condition before cervical cancer or prostate cancer
              would affect their health. Additionally, certain diseases, such as
              cervical cancer, become less common with advancing age. As a
              result, many screening tests are not recommended forever: at some
              point in your life, your doctor may tell you that you no longer
              need to repeat a screening test, even one you finally got used to
              having.

            <p class="blog__p">
              Tip 1: Match your food preferences If a diet eliminates your
              favorite foods, it can be challenging to follow. You may even find
              that when your favorite foods are off-limits, you crave them even
              more. If you thrive on variety, a diet limited to a narrow list of
              foods can become too monotonous to maintain. Also, restricting
              food variety could result in inadequate vitamin or mineral intake.
              Tip 2: Consider your lifestyle Time commitment If you spend hours
              shopping, meal planning, and cooking for a diet, it will be harder
              to sustain if you are too busy juggling work, family, and other
              commitments. Social factors If you value family meals or dining
              with friends, a plan that doesn't allow you to eat the same foods
              as others may leave you feeling left out and deprived. Cost If a
              diet plan requires expensive ingredients, supplements, or
              exclusive meals to order, and you are on a budget, it won't be a
              good fit for you. Don't let cost be a barrier to meeting your
              goals. Healthy eating can be affordable. Tip 3: Prioritize health
              and safety As a consumer, use a "buyer beware" mindset when you
              consider which diet to follow. Weight loss is big business, and
              safety may or may not be a part of the equation. If you need help
              deciding what type of weight-loss plan is best for you, ask your
              healthcare provider or dietitian for guidance. We recommend a
              gradual rate of weight-loss, from 1-2 pounds a week, for example.
              Make sure a diet plan is in sync with your current medical
              conditions and your age. The same is true for essential nutrient
              and calorie requirements. Choose an eating plan that supports your
              needs and conditions, and always check with your doctor to be
              certain. Tip 4: Look to the long term While you may choose a plan
              to meet your initial weight loss goals, at some point, you will
              need a plan to follow for the long term. Choose one that
              encourages affordable, accessible, and acceptable healthy food
              choices just right for you. If the weight-loss plan does not help
              you learn about nutritious food choices and portion control, you
              might regain weight once you are off the diet. Weight loss is only
              half of the journey. Keeping the weight off is just as important
              as the initial weight loss. Try to keep the long view in mind when
              choosing a plan. The best weight-loss diet may not be a "diet" at
              all, but rather a sustainable lifestyle. Tip 5: Be a wise consumer
              Does a plan promise weight loss without exercise? Offer a quick
              fix? Rely more on testimonials than evidence? Promote expensive
              supplements? These are all red flags. Trust your instincts. If it
              sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Here are some trusted
              resources to help you overlook the hype, and find which diet is
              best for you: American Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics: Weight

              exercise professionals answering tough questions. It’s important
              to be prepared for these conversations and have access to the
              information and resources you need to respond appropriately. It
              also means that you should be prepared to act within your scope of
              practice when addressing client questions and concerns.

              Before diving into a Q&A covering potential client questions,
              let’s first explore what this statement actually means to you as a
              health coach or exercise professional. This is a great example of
              why you should encourage your clients to avoid overreacting to a
              single news story or piece of research. A lot of the chatter on
              social media since the WHO released this statement has been about
              the need to completely avoid eating any products with NSS if you
              want to maintain good overall health, but is that really the case?
              Is it true that your clients can never drink a diet soda again if
              they want to be fit or healthy? Of course not. The bottom line is
              that this statement shouldn’t change anything about how you coach
              your clients regarding their nutrition. Keeping sugar intake
              within reasonable limits and avoiding eating too many processed
              foods (which is where most NSS are found) should already be a part
              of the advice you provide. Too many people take an all-or-nothing
              approach to nutrition—always eat this, never eat that—which all
              ACE Certified Professionals know rarely works in the real world.
              So, your role in these situations is to serve as a voice of reason
              in helping your clients interpret the science and make the best
              choices they can as often as they can. We know that some of your
              clients may be turning to you for advice and have questions after
              hearing this in the news. To best equip you to answer these
              questions, ACE has compiled some frequently asked questions and
              answers to help you communicate these new guidelines.

              As women, we already have a lot on our agenda. Oftentimes, we’re
              may find ourselves accepting additional tasks and responsibilities
              that help others and taking on more of the “mental load” of
              running a household. This unfortunately leaves us very little time
              to care for ourselves. As a busy wife and mother of two, I know
              the guilt that can accompany carving our time for self-care.
              According to a USA Today poll, 1 in 3 people in the U.S. feel
              guilty when they take time for themselves, yet, 67% say they need
              more of it. We need to change the way we look at self-care. Making
              time to better yourself equips you to better care for those around
              you and it allows you to lift those up who depend on you. In my
              own experience, and what I hear from those that I coach, we feel
              and operate our best when we regularly exercise our mind, body and
              spirit. This can look different for each person but here are some
              examples: The MIND: Freeing and strengthening your mind might mean
              reading a book, doing a crossword puzzle or learning something
              new. Challenging ourselves mentally can help us to feel more
              capable, confident and empowered. The SPIRIT: A joyful, peaceful
              spirit can be built through prayer, meditation, gratitude
              journaling or soaking in a sunset. Harvard studies show that
              people who write down a few “gratitude sentences” each day are
              more positive and optimistic about life. When we dwell on the
              positive thoughts and events in our lives, there’s little room for
              the negativity. The BODY: Exercising the body can bring all three
              components together. Exercise can oftentimes be intentionally
              uncomfortable, which is a mental challenge. There’s also a
              spiritual connection when we push, and connect to, our bodies,
              especially when practicing mindful movement. With discipline,
              you’ll begin to discover the incredible rewards of going for a
              run, taking a yoga class, or a strenuous lifting session. Research
              shows that exercise reduces stress and anxiety, improves self
              esteem, energizes your spirit and increases focus. Not to mention
              all of the physical benefits. Making time for all three of these
              might seem impossible, but I have some tips for how to squeeze
              them in, even on your busiest days. Remember, it’s all about
              prioritizing, scheduling and making the most of your time. 1.
              PRIORITIZE: You must schedule priorities rather than prioritizing
              your schedule. What I mean is, self-care must be more important
              than your to-do list. Write down your priorities and set time
              aside to make them happen. Set an appointment with yourself and
              don’t back out! 2. SAY "NO." It’s impossible say “yes” to
              everything and still have time for yourself. Sometimes “no” is
              necessary. 3. GET CREATIVE: Find small moments during your day to
              reset the body, mind and spirit. Roll down your windows on your
              drive home. Listen to an encouraging podcast. Go for a short walk
              and take note of all that you have to be grateful for. Making time
              is a challenge, but it’s worth it. A better, happier you is an
              appointment (with yourself) away. My morning mind, body and spirit
              routine usually takes about 40 minutes, but here’s a quick
              15-minute morning practice that can be done even on the busiest
              days. - 5 minute of reading: Read something that motivates or
              challenges you. I like following daily devotional reading plans.
              Each day is mapped out for me and only takes a few minutes. - 5
              minutes of gratitude: Write down 2-3 things you’re grateful for.
              Next, jot down 2-3 positive affirmations about yourself and say
              them out loud. - 5 minutes of movement: Get outside for a quick
              walk, jog down the street, work through a yoga flow, pump out as
              many push-ups, squats and sit ups as you can... anything to get
              the body moving! You can also break these up throughout the day,
              but I challenge you to take at least 15 minutes a day for 15 days
              and unlock the power of prioritizing YOU!
