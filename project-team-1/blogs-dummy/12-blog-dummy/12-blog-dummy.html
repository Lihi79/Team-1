              If you want to live a healthy life, you need to be cognizant of
              your health issues. For that, you visit a doctor to get a proper
              consultation and treatment face to face. As the time is changing,
              new innovations have taken up the place of traditional methods
              where almost everything has come online and reduced our efforts,
              time and money such as online doctor consultation. This service
              has enabled people to take online treatment through a video call
              without visiting a doctor. There are many platforms that are
              offering such services where people can enroll and get online
              doctor consultation and prescription in a quick and simple way.
              Almost every country has accepted such innovation which is saving
              people’s time and helping them to get treated online within the
              comfort of their home. Such technology is bridging the gap between
              the doctors and patients where they do not need to go one’s place
              for treatment. In Australia, many people are taking advantage of
              online consultation. They are aware of their health and due to
              having less time; they prefer to consult with an online doctor and
              share prescription in Australia which is a simple way to take
              proper treatment. In addition to this, doctor consultation fee in
              Australia is very cheap and handy which incurring patients to use
              such services. With the help of online medication, now you don’t
              need to stand in a queue for appointments. However, you can
              schedule your appointments through online consultation which is a
              convenient & quick way to approach the doctors. There are some
              introverted- shy people in the world who afraid of talking to
              doctors and share their illness. Such a platform enables people to
              talk to their doctors in private through video-calling and
              provides maximum privacy while consulting with a doctor. You will
              need to share some personal details about yourself so that the
              doctor could get an idea about your health and provide accurate
              solutions accordingly.

              as their new head coach on a two-year deal, with the option of a
              further year, from July 1. The 51-year-old Argentine, who returns
              to the Premier League following previous spells in charge of
              Tottenham and Southampton, permanently succeeds Graham Potter, who
              was dismissed at the start of April after less than seven months
              in charge.Frank Lampard, who led Chelsea on a caretaker basis
              until the end of the season following Potter's sacking, has left
              the club. Jesus Perez, Miguel d'Agostino, Toni Jimenez and
              Sebastiano Pochettino will form part of Pochettino's coaching
              staff at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's co-sporting directors Laurence

              standards of excellence, leadership qualities and character will
              serve Chelsea Football Club well as we move forward. "He is a
              winning coach, who has worked at the highest levels, in multiple
              leagues and languages. His ethos, tactical approach and commitment
              to development all made him the exceptional candidate." Owners

              “Will Ruin the Sport”: Toto Wolff Subtly Insults
            </h1>
            <h3 class="blog__subtitle" id="subtitle">
              In an ideal world, Red Bull would’ve been basking in the glory of
              their dominant run in the sport. To some extent, it’s safe to safe
              that they are, too. However, a dark cloud in the shape of their
              cost cap breach reprimand hangs over all their accolades. When the
              news had initially come out, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff made a huge
              hue and cry about it.

              Almost a year since the Austrian has not changed his stance. The
              Milton-Keynes-based outfit has nailed the RB19. As a consequence,
              nobody is fast enough to catch them. Naturally, many have written
              the 2023 season off. In light of this frustrating reality, ideas
              are being pushed to introduce regulations that balance out the
              performance of cars. Mercedes are a country mile behind the Bulls
              currently. Even with their revised W14 upgrades at Monaco, the
              team are still quite some way off a championship bid. You’d
              imagine Wolff to be in favor of a rule change that will bring them
              closer to Max Verstappen & Co. But he thinks otherwise. When
              quizzed about such a measure to be adopted, Wolff responded, “If
              we start balancing performance, we will ruin this sport,” as
              quoted by Motorsport Week. He then went on to explain his stance,
              and along the way took a subtle dig at Red Bull’s past
              misdemeanors. “This is a class of its own, the best driver in the
              best car, spending the same amount of money (as the other teams,
              ed.), and winning the championship. If you break the rules, you
              must be severely punished. Only then, but not for doing a good
              job.” Wolff seems happy where he and his team are right now. But
              he does have his eyes firmly set on catching them up eventually.
              Mercedes will be eagerly awaiting an opportunity to get back to
              their glory days and dominant ways. But the Austrian team
              principal is wary of the constraints of this sport, development
              wise. Hence, he has set himself a cautious deadline to get back to
              the top again. According to Crash.net, Wolff said, “I think the
              length [of time before catching Red Bull] is probably between six
              and 12 months. That’s the time that it really took for us [last
              year] to figure out what was actually happening with the car.”
