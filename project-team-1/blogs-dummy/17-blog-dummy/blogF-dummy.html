              A few months ago, sick with a cold on a Saturday morning, feeling
              miserable about the fact that I was stuck at home alone for the
              weekend, I checked Find My Friends. It’s an app that comes
              standard on iPhones these days, the same one that tracks your
              phone or laptop or Airpods in case you lose them. But instead of
              devices, it shows the location of your friends, or rather, their
              phones. I tend to check Find My Friends when I want to see if
              anyone’s nearby and might be up for a spontaneous hang, or else
              just to see their little bubbles in some kind of bizarre exercise
              in virtual closeness. But that morning I noticed one of my
              friends’ bubbles wasn’t where it usually was. It was miles away,
              in a neighborhood where neither of us knew anyone. She was, I
              assumed, at a random person’s apartment where, we can go ahead and
              assume, she’d slept over the night before. It probably says a lot
              about me that my first thought was, “Good for her!” and not, “Is
              she okay?” considering the fact that for many women, the point of
              location sharing with their friends is to ensure safety — that if
              they share their location before heading out on a solo trip or a
              first date, they’ll know that at least one person will know where
              to find them if the worst happens. But I’m more interested in the
              knotty social questions that mass location sharing forces us all
              to ask of each other and ourselves: How do we decide who to share
              — and not share — our location with? When does looking at your
              friends’ bubbles go from cute to creepy? Or, in my case, how weird
              is it to ask my friend for juicy details on her one-night stand?
              Friends sharing their real-time locations with each other is a
              pretty recent facet of modern life. Though apps like Foursquare
              have been around since the dawn of the smartphone age, mass
              location sharing was only introduced around 2017, when Google
              rolled out location sharing on its Maps function and Snapchat
              launched Snap Map, allowing users to see where their contacts were
              at any moment. By the time Apple merged the Find My iPhone and
              Find My Friends apps into a single app called “Find My” in 2019,
              location sharing had become just another type of social
              networking, despite the fact that for many people, it still feels
              a little icky. “As a non-location sharer, I see it as the natural
              conclusion of the digital-age expectation that we’re always
              online, always available, and have no reasonable expectation of a
              private, offline life,” explains Scott Nover, a tech reporter at
              Quartz. “We’re no longer just putting up an ‘away message,’ or
              occasionally ‘checking in’ somewhere on social media, but
              broadcasting our whereabouts at all times.”

              Biggest lesson/challenge: "My biggest struggle as a business owner
              has been learning when to dig in on an idea until it works, when
              to pivot, and when to pick up a new concept completely. As an
              entrepreneur, you have so many options, and the roller coaster of
              'This is going to be awesome' and 'What was I thinking?' can
              sometimes give you whiplash. It's been important to learn how to
              step back, ignore what other businesses are doing, and evaluate
              our progress. What is working? What isn't? What does the audience
              think? Then I make choices based on what I'm actively seeing,
              without letting emotion or 'shiny object syndrome' take over."

              On a flight about a year ago, I found myself in a predicament: I
              could not pay for my customary glass of plane wine to help calm
              the nerves. The problem wasn’t that I didn’t have cash or a credit
              card on me but instead that I didn’t have the airline’s app, which
              was necessary to complete the transaction. I was motivated to get
              the plane wine, but not that motivated — I gave up somewhere
              between downloading the app on the shoddy in-flight wifi and
              uploading my credit card to it. So now it sits idle on my phone,
              as do countless other apps I’ve had to get for one reason or
              another over the years, the vast majority of which I do not want
              or use. It really does feel like there’s an app for everything
              these days — often for things where they’re not really needed. We
              all managed to do business with each other for years and years
              without having to pull out our phones at every corner. Admittedly,
              the cultural peak of “there’s an app for that” mania was years
              ago, at a moment when, in many cases, said apps actually proposed
              making our lives better. But it’s been forever since many people
              have felt enthusiastic about downloading an application; instead
              of serving customers, apps now serve companies and have
              transformed into a sort of necessary evil to receive some product
              or service. The hotel has an app, the dentist has an app, the
              restaurant down the street has an app.

              As women, we already have a lot on our agenda. Oftentimes, we’re
              may find ourselves accepting additional tasks and responsibilities
              that help others and taking on more of the “mental load” of
              running a household. This unfortunately leaves us very little time
              to care for ourselves. As a busy wife and mother of two, I know
              the guilt that can accompany carving our time for self-care.
              According to a USA Today poll, 1 in 3 people in the U.S. feel
              guilty when they take time for themselves, yet, 67% say they need
              more of it. We need to change the way we look at self-care. Making
              time to better yourself equips you to better care for those around
              you and it allows you to lift those up who depend on you. In my
              own experience, and what I hear from those that I coach, we feel
              and operate our best when we regularly exercise our mind, body and
              spirit. This can look different for each person but here are some
              examples: The MIND: Freeing and strengthening your mind might mean
              reading a book, doing a crossword puzzle or learning something
              new. Challenging ourselves mentally can help us to feel more
              capable, confident and empowered. The SPIRIT: A joyful, peaceful
              spirit can be built through prayer, meditation, gratitude
              journaling or soaking in a sunset. Harvard studies show that
              people who write down a few “gratitude sentences” each day are
              more positive and optimistic about life. When we dwell on the
              positive thoughts and events in our lives, there’s little room for
              the negativity. The BODY: Exercising the body can bring all three
              components together. Exercise can oftentimes be intentionally
              uncomfortable, which is a mental challenge. There’s also a
              spiritual connection when we push, and connect to, our bodies,
              especially when practicing mindful movement. With discipline,
              you’ll begin to discover the incredible rewards of going for a
              run, taking a yoga class, or a strenuous lifting session. Research
              shows that exercise reduces stress and anxiety, improves self
              esteem, energizes your spirit and increases focus. Not to mention
              all of the physical benefits. Making time for all three of these
              might seem impossible, but I have some tips for how to squeeze
              them in, even on your busiest days. Remember, it’s all about
              prioritizing, scheduling and making the most of your time. 1.
              PRIORITIZE: You must schedule priorities rather than prioritizing
              your schedule. What I mean is, self-care must be more important
              than your to-do list. Write down your priorities and set time
              aside to make them happen. Set an appointment with yourself and
              don’t back out! 2. SAY "NO." It’s impossible say “yes” to
              everything and still have time for yourself. Sometimes “no” is
              necessary. 3. GET CREATIVE: Find small moments during your day to
              reset the body, mind and spirit. Roll down your windows on your
              drive home. Listen to an encouraging podcast. Go for a short walk
              and take note of all that you have to be grateful for. Making time
              is a challenge, but it’s worth it. A better, happier you is an
              appointment (with yourself) away. My morning mind, body and spirit
              routine usually takes about 40 minutes, but here’s a quick
              15-minute morning practice that can be done even on the busiest
              days. - 5 minute of reading: Read something that motivates or
              challenges you. I like following daily devotional reading plans.
              Each day is mapped out for me and only takes a few minutes. - 5
              minutes of gratitude: Write down 2-3 things you’re grateful for.
              Next, jot down 2-3 positive affirmations about yourself and say
              them out loud. - 5 minutes of movement: Get outside for a quick
              walk, jog down the street, work through a yoga flow, pump out as
              many push-ups, squats and sit ups as you can... anything to get
              the body moving! You can also break these up throughout the day,
              but I challenge you to take at least 15 minutes a day for 15 days
              and unlock the power of prioritizing YOU!

              We are less than one year away from the biggest dance of
              democracy, the Lok Sabha elections of 2024, which will bring most
              Indian adults to the polling booths. Given India’s size and scale,
              anybody serious about forming the government in 2024 should not
              wait to get into LS election mode. In some ways, election season
              never really stops in India, with frequent state assembly polls,
              municipal polls etc. TV debates and social media are a permanent
              political battleground for various parties, with 24×7 praise and
              criticism. But most of our public debate goes into shouting about
              who should be running the country, rather than how they should be
              running it. Still, general elections are a different beast,
              India’s perennial election mode on heavy steroids. What should you
              expect this year? The most bitter, brutal, undignified and
              cringeworthy statements. Fake news. Truth will be irrelevant where
              ‘feels right’ is another way of saying ‘confirms my already
              existing bias’.

              On a flight about a year ago, I found myself in a predicament: I
              could not pay for my customary glass of plane wine to help calm
              the nerves. The problem wasn’t that I didn’t have cash or a credit
              card on me but instead that I didn’t have the airline’s app, which
              was necessary to complete the transaction. I was motivated to get
              the plane wine, but not that motivated — I gave up somewhere
              between downloading the app on the shoddy in-flight wifi and
              uploading my credit card to it. So now it sits idle on my phone,
              as do countless other apps I’ve had to get for one reason or
              another over the years, the vast majority of which I do not want
              or use. It really does feel like there’s an app for everything
              these days — often for things where they’re not really needed. We
              all managed to do business with each other for years and years
              without having to pull out our phones at every corner. Admittedly,
              the cultural peak of “there’s an app for that” mania was years
              ago, at a moment when, in many cases, said apps actually proposed
              making our lives better. But it’s been forever since many people
              have felt enthusiastic about downloading an application; instead
              of serving customers, apps now serve companies and have
              transformed into a sort of necessary evil to receive some product
              or service. The hotel has an app, the dentist has an app, the
              restaurant down the street has an app.
