              Baseball is not exactly a popular sport in Israel, and few
              Israelis have embraced it. But when the Israeli baseball team
              qualified for the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021, some
              Israelis tuned in and cheered on its players, most of whom were
              Americans with dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

              Their quest for a medal — gold, silver or bronze — unfolds in
              Israel Swings for Gold, a well-crafted documentary by Seth Kramer,
              Daniel Miller and Jeremy Newberger which opens in theatres in
              Florida on May 5. Interestingly enough, much of the footage was
              shot by the players themselves because the media was not allowed
              into the Olympic Village during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is
              a sequel to Heading Home, which documented the exploits of
              Israel’s baseball squad at the 2017 World Baseball Classic in
              Seoul, South Korea. At the Olympics, Israel, the lowest-ranking
              team, faced five opponents — the United States, Japan, South
              Korea, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. “We were the Jamaican
              bobsled team of baseball,” says one of the Israelis ruefully but
              realistically. They faced political hostility at their training
              games in the United States. Palestinian women chanted, “Free, free
              Palestine” and “Long live Palestine.” Anti-Zionist haredim held
              aloft anti-Israel placards. One protester likened Israel to an
              apartheid state. Security was tight at the Olympic Village, but
              the team had no compunction in displaying the blue-and-white
              Israeli flag on the balcony of its living quarters. At the opening
              ceremony, a moment of silence was observed for the 11 Israeli
              athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, and the
              players from Israel were clearly touched by this gesture. Yet they
              encountered animosity. Some received death threats. Still others
              were rebuffed when they sought to exchange athletic pins with some
              athletes from certain nations. The film focuses on the games in
              which the Israelis appeared. Much to their disappointment, they
              won only one game. “When you lose, that’s tough,” says one of the
              players. But at least they moved into the elimination round, which
              was no small achievement, and enjoyed the privilege of
              participating in the Olympics. Unfortunately, they will not get a
              second chance to prove themselves on the field. Baseball has been
              eliminated from the 2024 Olympics, having been replaced by
              breakdancing.

              Chelsea have appointed former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino
              as their new head coach on a two-year deal, with the option of a
              further year, from July 1. The 51-year-old Argentine, who returns
              to the Premier League following previous spells in charge of
              Tottenham and Southampton, permanently succeeds Graham Potter, who
              was dismissed at the start of April after less than seven months
              in charge.Frank Lampard, who led Chelsea on a caretaker basis
              until the end of the season following Potter's sacking, has left
              the club. Jesus Perez, Miguel d'Agostino, Toni Jimenez and
              Sebastiano Pochettino will form part of Pochettino's coaching
              staff at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea's co-sporting directors Laurence
              Stewart and Paul Winstanley said: "Mauricio's experience,
              standards of excellence, leadership qualities and character will
              serve Chelsea Football Club well as we move forward. "He is a
              winning coach, who has worked at the highest levels, in multiple
              leagues and languages. His ethos, tactical approach and commitment
              to development all made him the exceptional candidate." Owners
              Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali, Jose E. Feliciano, Mark Walter and
              Hansjorg Wyss added: "The sporting team conducted a diligent and
              thoughtful process that the board is proud of. We are delighted
              that Mauricio will be joining Chelsea. Mauricio is a world-class
              coach with an outstanding track record. We are all looking forward
              to having him on board."

              “Will Ruin the Sport”: Toto Wolff Subtly Insults Red Bull for Past

              In an ideal world, Red Bull would’ve been basking in the glory of
              their dominant run in the sport. To some extent, it’s safe to safe
              that they are, too. However, a dark cloud in the shape of their

              news had initially come out, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff made a huge
              hue and cry about it.

              Almost a year since the Austrian has not changed his stance. The
              Milton-Keynes-based outfit has nailed the RB19. As a consequence,
              nobody is fast enough to catch them. Naturally, many have written
              the 2023 season off. In light of this frustrating reality, ideas
              are being pushed to introduce regulations that balance out the
              performance of cars. Mercedes are a country mile behind the Bulls
              currently. Even with their revised W14 upgrades at Monaco, the
              team are still quite some way off a championship bid. You’d
              imagine Wolff to be in favor of a rule change that will bring them
              closer to Max Verstappen & Co. But he thinks otherwise. When
              quizzed about such a measure to be adopted, Wolff responded, “If
              we start balancing performance, we will ruin this sport,” as
              quoted by Motorsport Week. He then went on to explain his stance,
              and along the way took a subtle dig at Red Bull’s past
              misdemeanors. “This is a class of its own, the best driver in the
              best car, spending the same amount of money (as the other teams,
              ed.), and winning the championship. If you break the rules, you
              must be severely punished. Only then, but not for doing a good
              job.” Wolff seems happy where he and his team are right now. But
              he does have his eyes firmly set on catching them up eventually.
              Mercedes will be eagerly awaiting an opportunity to get back to
              their glory days and dominant ways. But the Austrian team
              principal is wary of the constraints of this sport, development
              wise. Hence, he has set himself a cautious deadline to get back to
              the top again. According to Crash.net, Wolff said, “I think the
              length [of time before catching Red Bull] is probably between six
              and 12 months. That’s the time that it really took for us [last
              year] to figure out what was actually happening with the car.”
