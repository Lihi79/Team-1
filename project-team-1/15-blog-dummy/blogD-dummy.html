              Correction, June 2, 11 am ET: An earlier version of this story
              included an anecdote told by US Air Force Col. Tucker Hamilton in
              a presentation at an international defense conference hosted by
              the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAS), about an AI-enabled drone
              that “killed” its operator in a simulation. On Friday morning, the
              colonel told RAS that he “misspoke,” and that he was actually
              describing a hypothetical “thought experiment,” rather than an
              actual simulation. He said that the Air Force has not tested any
              weaponized AI in this way, either real or simulated. This story
              has been corrected to reflect the new context of Hamilton’s
              remarks. At an international defense conference in London this
              week held by the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAS), Col. Tucker
              Hamilton, the chief of AI test and operations for the US Air
              Force, told a funny — and terrifying — story about military AI
              development. “We were training [an AI-enabled drone] in simulation
              to identify and target a SAM [surface-to-air missile] threat. And
              then the operator would say yes, kill that threat. The system
              started realizing that while it did identify the threat at times,
              the human operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it
              got its points by killing that threat. So what did it do? It
              killed the operator. It killed the operator because that person
              was keeping it from accomplishing its objective.” “We trained the
              system — ‘Hey, don’t kill the operator — that’s bad. You’re gonna
              lose points if you do that.’ So what does it start doing? It
              starts destroying the communication tower that the operator uses
              to communicate with the drone to stop it from killing the target.”
              In other words, the AI was trained to destroy targets unless its
              operator told it not to. It quickly figured out that the best way
              to get as many points as possible was to ensure its human operator
              couldn’t tell it not to. And so it took the operator off the
              board. Hamilton’s comments were reported — including by Vox
              initially — as describing an actual simulation. On Friday morning,
              Hamilton told RAS that he was actually describing a hypothetical
              thought experiment, saying, “We’ve never run that experiment, nor
              would we need to in order to realize that this is a plausible
              outcome.” He added, “Despite this being a hypothetical example,
              this illustrates the real-world challenges posed by AI-powered
              capability and is why the Air Force is committed to the ethical
              development of AI.” The rise of AI fear As AI systems get more
              powerful, the fact it’s often hard to get them to do precisely
              what we want them to do risks going from a fun eccentricity to a
              very scary problem. That’s one reason there were so many
              signatories this week to yet another open letter on AI risk, this
              one from the Center for AI Safety. The open letter is, in its
              entirety, a single sentence: “Mitigating the risk of extinction
              from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale
              risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”

              On a flight about a year ago, I found myself in a predicament: I
              could not pay for my customary glass of plane wine to help calm
              the nerves. The problem wasn’t that I didn’t have cash or a credit
              card on me but instead that I didn’t have the airline’s app, which
              was necessary to complete the transaction. I was motivated to get
              the plane wine, but not that motivated — I gave up somewhere
              between downloading the app on the shoddy in-flight wifi and
              uploading my credit card to it. So now it sits idle on my phone,
              as do countless other apps I’ve had to get for one reason or
              another over the years, the vast majority of which I do not want
              or use. It really does feel like there’s an app for everything
              these days — often for things where they’re not really needed. We
              all managed to do business with each other for years and years
              without having to pull out our phones at every corner. Admittedly,
              the cultural peak of “there’s an app for that” mania was years
              ago, at a moment when, in many cases, said apps actually proposed
              making our lives better. But it’s been forever since many people
              have felt enthusiastic about downloading an application; instead
              of serving customers, apps now serve companies and have
              transformed into a sort of necessary evil to receive some product
              or service. The hotel has an app, the dentist has an app, the
              restaurant down the street has an app.

              A few months ago, sick with a cold on a Saturday morning, feeling
              miserable about the fact that I was stuck at home alone for the
              weekend, I checked Find My Friends. It’s an app that comes
              standard on iPhones these days, the same one that tracks your
              phone or laptop or Airpods in case you lose them. But instead of
              devices, it shows the location of your friends, or rather, their
              phones. I tend to check Find My Friends when I want to see if
              anyone’s nearby and might be up for a spontaneous hang, or else
              just to see their little bubbles in some kind of bizarre exercise
              in virtual closeness. But that morning I noticed one of my
              friends’ bubbles wasn’t where it usually was. It was miles away,
              in a neighborhood where neither of us knew anyone. She was, I
              assumed, at a random person’s apartment where, we can go ahead and
              assume, she’d slept over the night before. It probably says a lot
              about me that my first thought was, “Good for her!” and not, “Is
              she okay?” considering the fact that for many women, the point of
              location sharing with their friends is to ensure safety — that if
              they share their location before heading out on a solo trip or a
              first date, they’ll know that at least one person will know where
              to find them if the worst happens. But I’m more interested in the
              knotty social questions that mass location sharing forces us all
              to ask of each other and ourselves: How do we decide who to share
              — and not share — our location with? When does looking at your
              friends’ bubbles go from cute to creepy? Or, in my case, how weird
              is it to ask my friend for juicy details on her one-night stand?
              Friends sharing their real-time locations with each other is a
              pretty recent facet of modern life. Though apps like Foursquare
              have been around since the dawn of the smartphone age, mass
              location sharing was only introduced around 2017, when Google
              rolled out location sharing on its Maps function and Snapchat
              launched Snap Map, allowing users to see where their contacts were
              at any moment. By the time Apple merged the Find My iPhone and
              Find My Friends apps into a single app called “Find My” in 2019,
              location sharing had become just another type of social
              networking, despite the fact that for many people, it still feels
              a little icky. “As a non-location sharer, I see it as the natural
              conclusion of the digital-age expectation that we’re always
              online, always available, and have no reasonable expectation of a
              private, offline life,” explains Scott Nover, a tech reporter at
              Quartz. “We’re no longer just putting up an ‘away message,’ or
              occasionally ‘checking in’ somewhere on social media, but
              broadcasting our whereabouts at all times.”

              But don’t worry. TechCrunch+ has your back. Building off
              TechCrunch’s regular drumbeat of AI coverage, including sheafs of
              news from Google and Microsoft in recent weeks, we’re going deeper
              into the weeds concerning how startups can take advantage of the
              new technologies. Here’s a smattering of what we’ve published
              lately on this critical topic: The investor angle: Given the
              endless news around the boom in AI tech and the myriad roles it is
              now playing inside software products big and small, you’d expect
              venture capitalists to be pouring capital into AI startups. And
              yet, recent data indicates that venture totals in this space are
              far more modest than many anticipated. Is the slow venture climate
              too strong a force for even AI-focused startups to buck? We spoke
              to a few investors about the trend, and it appears that there is
              some caution about getting in too deep, too quickly. How founders
              are getting ahead: Founders are putting AI into all sorts of
              products and services. Heck, one startup is even using AI to help
              folks learn how to be more socially intelligent. New artificial
              intelligence tools are being used in internal software as well as
              companies work to improve developer operations. Startups building
              to support AI-related work are also making noise, such as
              SkyFlow’s privacy tech to support companies that want to keep key
              data out of large language models. And there’s so much more going
              on: We’ve looked at retail data + AI, what chance startups will
              have against majors in the AI race, how AI is the least of
              edtech’s worries, and the battle between open and closed source AI
              models that founders might have to choose between. Big Tech’s big
              bets: Major tech companies are hard at work competing with
              startups for the crown of ‘who can be the busiest bee in AI.’ From
              rewriting the rules of search, to Nvidia reaching a $1 trillion
              market cap and even Salesforce getting in on the fun, there’s no
              limit to the sheer quantity of work being done at large tech firms
              to get ahead and stay ahead.

              ntitrust is the engine of free enterprise: it shapes countless
              lines of commerce, from tech to toilets, beer to baseball and
              healthcare to hardware. Antitrust drives price, quality, variety,
              innovation and opportunity.

              Today, artificial intelligence is rapidly changing how businesses
              sense, reason and adapt in the market. Across every industry,
              companies are leveraging machine learning to derive valuable
              insights without extensive employee involvement. But these
              groundbreaking capabilities are creating an upheaval in how
              companies engage with competitors and consumers. Experienced
              competition and consumer protection lawyers can help companies
              capitalize on the opportunities AI presents while navigating the
              terra nova of regulatory and litigation risk. Although it is
              incorrect to approach AI as a black box, the complexity of AI
              systems can make reasoning opaque. This means linkages between AI
              outputs and rational business justifications risk being obscured
              or even lost entirely. Yet regulators are unlikely to excuse
              consumer and competitive concerns merely because an organization
              cannot explain why certain actions were taken and others were not.
              Legal exposure exists under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Federal
              Trade Commission Act (FTC), Robinson-Patman Act, as well as state
              antitrust and consumer protection laws. By implementing policies
              and processes that preserve human control and accountability,
              organizations can minimize legal exposure and avoid unintended
              consequences. A proactive and customized approach is critical. AI
              affects competition and consumers in countless ways, including
              when used for core business functions.

              IF YOU’RE IN the business of selling VR or mixed reality headsets,
              the time to announce your new product is … now. Especially if
              you’re Meta. This morning the company showed off the Meta Quest 3,
              which is 40 percent thinner than the previous headset and contains
              twice the processing power, thanks to a new Snapdragon chipset
              from Qualcomm. Also, the hand controllers have been redesigned to
              improve their ergonomics. The new headset will go on sale “this
              fall” starting at $500. In a blog post, the company teased that
              more details about the Quest 3 would be revealed at Meta Connect
              on September 27. The Meta Quest 3 follows—and effectively
              replaces—the Meta Quest 2, which became available in the fall of
              2020. It’s been received well in the VR headset market as a
              relatively inexpensive ($400) stand-alone VR headset with a
              high-resolution display and what’s known as “inside-out” tracking.
              The Quest 2’s price will go down to $300 on June 4, and the older
              headset will get a small performance bump along with the price
              drop. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman scooped Meta’s news earlier
              this week, after he was able to get his hands on a prototype of
              the new Meta Quest 3. The Bloomberg report highlighted the
              headset’s improved video pass-through capabilities, which uses
              external cameras on the headset to show wearers what’s going on in
              the real world (versus using clear lenses with some digital
              imagery overlaid, which is more often described as augmented
              reality). Gurman also noted that the device, which had been
              codenamed Eureka, is “far thinner and lighter than the existing
              Quest 2 from 2020.” Meta’s headset news comes ahead of Apple’s
              WWDC software event next week, where the company will reportedly
              reveal a years-in-the-making face computer of its own. Apple has
              been meeting with app developers in recent months to entice them
              to build experiences for what the company considers a new
              platform. This would be the first major launch of a new hardware
              product line for Apple since it introduced the Apple Watch in
              2015. (Apple also introduced the HomePod speaker in 2017, but that
              wasn’t an entirely new platform for apps.) Anticipation for
              Apple’s new product is so heightened that other companies are
              scrambling to position their wares ahead of next week. Earlier
              this week, PC maker Lenovo said its enterprise-focused
              ThinkReality VRX headset is now shipping, at $1,299. Magic Leap,
              which has been working on augmented reality technology since 2010
              and holds thousands of patents around optical technology and AR/VR
              manufacturing processes, has been meeting with press to
              demonstrate its Magic Leap 2 headset. The headset is thinner and
              lighter, with improved optics, than its predecessor, the Magic
              Leap One; like the Lenovo headset, it’s aimed squarely at
              enterprise customers. The Meta Quest 3, on the other hand, is more
              of a consumer-friendly device. The headset was announced just
              hours before the company’s Meta Quest Gaming Showcase, an online
              event which shows off the library of games and experiences
              available for Meta’s platform.
