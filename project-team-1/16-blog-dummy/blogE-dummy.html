              stems from other less emotional reasons. Israel receives $3.8B
              annually in US government support. Since its founding, it has
              received nearly $160B. This is financial support that I and other
              US taxpayers provide. I have a say in where my money goes. It is
              hypocritical for some Israelis and Israeli politicians to condemn
              intervention by US citizens, and at the same time lobby the US
              Congress for billions in annual support. It is in the US national
              interest that Israel remain a strong democracy. The shared
              democratic values of the US and Israel ensure a strong strategic
              bond, giving US interests a foothold in the middle east. US
              citizens have an interest in maintaining this strategic bond. A
              dictatorship in Israel could drift to align itself with Russia, or
              China. Those of us who see this as dangerous have the right to
              act.

              We are less than one year away from the biggest dance of
              democracy, the Lok Sabha elections of 2024, which will bring most
              Indian adults to the polling booths. Given India’s size and scale,
              anybody serious about forming the government in 2024 should not
              wait to get into LS election mode. In some ways, election season
              never really stops in India, with frequent state assembly polls,
              municipal polls etc. TV debates and social media are a permanent
              political battleground for various parties, with 24×7 praise and
              criticism. But most of our public debate goes into shouting about
              who should be running the country, rather than how they should be
              running it. Still, general elections are a different beast,
              India’s perennial election mode on heavy steroids. What should you
              expect this year? The most bitter, brutal, undignified and
              cringeworthy statements. Fake news. Truth will be irrelevant where
              ‘feels right’ is another way of saying ‘confirms my already
              existing bias’.

              Tel Aviv is the city of Pride. Its Gay Pride parade is the
              biggest, most colorful celebration of diversity, inclusivity and
              freedom, rivaling San Francisco in its own way. Jerusalem, on the
              other hand, is threatening to become the City of Shame. In a
              prelude the Jerusalem Pride Parade, frenzied death threats have
              been made public, and coalition members, even within the Likud,
              have been quoted as saying the Pride Parade is an abomination, or
              claiming that parents make their sons gay by giving them dolls to
              play with. In the meantime, far-right MK Avi Maoz will have the
              authority to ensure LGBTQ young people, or straight ones for that
              matter, never learn the facts (including the one that playing with
              dolls does not make one gay) about sexual and gender identity.
              And, in an ironic twist, the lawyer who once defended the brother
              of the man who stabbed Shira Banki to death during Jerusalem’s
              2015 Pride Parade is now the Minister of Internal Security,
              responsible for the safety of all marchers in this year’s Parade.
              The police are beefing up security for the Parade, but fear is in
              the air. Pride Month organizers could, of course, stick to Tel
              Aviv, where they are welcome, and avoid the tensions and
              counter-protest in Jerusalem. They could leave that city to fester
              in its own fanatic juices.

              Lack of firsthand experience: Diaspora Jews may not have firsthand
              experience living in Israel or the Palestinian territories, which
              can make it difficult to fully understand the complexities of the
              political situation. They also don’t share the heaviest burdens or
              pay the heaviest costs of living in Israel. Fear of alienation:
              Expressing opinions that are contrary to the dominant narrative
              within the Jewish community can lead to feelings of alienation or
              ostracism.There may be pressure from within the Jewish community
              to conform to a particular political viewpoint on Israel, which
              can make it difficult for individuals to express their own
              opinion. Perceived lack of influence: Some diaspora Jews may feel
              that their opinions on Israeli politics carry little weight, given
              that they are not Israeli citizens and do not have a direct say in
              Israeli policy. Overall, these factors can create a challenging
              environment for diaspora Jews who wish to express their opinions
              on Israeli politics. However, it is important to remember that
              open and respectful dialogue is essential for building
              understanding and finding solutions to complex issues. How do we
              resolve this tension? Matt moderated this debate between Calev who
              argues for Diaspora Jews to be reserved, and Mike who argues for
              robust expression of opinions. Let us know what you think about

              Israel’s Constitution While Israel’s Declaration of Independence
              declared that the new state would have a formal constitution, a
              political decision was made not to draw up the constitution at
              once, but to adopt a series of basic laws that would eventually
              form the country’s constitution. Basic laws dealing with the
              branches of government were enacted, but most of these laws were
              not entrenched, and can be amended by a simple parliamentary
              majority. Furthermore, the Supreme Court originally held that the
              basic laws did not have superior normative status to regular
              legislation. After the enactment in 1992 of two basic laws dealing
              with human rights the Supreme Court changed course. In 1995 the
              Court held that all basic laws have constitutional status, that
              parliamentary legislation is subject to judicial review, and that
              the Court may strike down such legislation if it is incompatible
              with the basic laws. In the 27 years that have passed since then
              the Court has struck down provisions in 22 laws, while upholding
              the constitutionality of dozens of laws that have been challenged
              before it. Political background In the November 2022 elections the
              right-wing and religious parties’ bloc, headed by Netanyahu’s
              Likud party, achieved a majority of 64 members in the 120-member
              Knesset. Even though Netanyahu is on trial before the district
              court in Jerusalem on corruption charges, he was given the mandate
              to form a new government. This involved reaching agreements with
              the smaller parties in the bloc. Part of the demands of those
              parties were that some pieces of legislation be enacted before the
              new government is presented to the Knesset. The assumption of the
              present, newly elected, majority in the Knesset that was sworn in
              on November 15 is simple: since they have a parliamentary
              majority, they can do whatever they like. The laws being
              considered at the moment aim to remove any obstacles that may
              prevent them from doing exactly that. Override clause It is indeed
              fairly clear that some of the proposals that have been aired by
              parties in the coalition bloc, such as legislation that would put
              a stop to Netanyahu’s criminal trial, would not stand up to
              judicial review. The proposed “solution” to this obstacle is to
              introduce an override clause into Israel’s basic laws. Such a
              clause would enable a simple Knesset majority to introduce a
              provision in a law that has been struck down by the Court, or even
              a law that may be struck down by the Court, according to which the
              said law would be valid notwithstanding the provisions of the
              basic laws, or the judgment of the Court. In a parliamentary
              system, in which coalition discipline means that the executive
              branch has effective control over the Knesset, such an override
              clause would spell the end to constitutional and judicial
              protection of human rights in the country, and would also allow
              corrupt politicians to continue to wield political power. With the
              present populist majority in the Knesset, it is hard to believe
              that there will be other constraints on the use of unbridled
              governmental power.
