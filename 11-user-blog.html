          Baseball is not exactly a popular sport in Israel, and few Israelis<br />
          have embraced it. But when the Israeli baseball team qualified for
          the<br />
          summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021, some Israelis tuned in and<br />
          cheered on its players, most of whom were Americans with dual<br />
          U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

          Their quest for a medal — gold, silver or bronze — unfolds in
          Israel<br />
          Swings for Gold, a well-crafted documentary by Seth Kramer, Daniel<br />
          Miller and Jeremy Newberger which opens in theatres in Florida on
          May<br />
          5. Interestingly enough, much of the footage was shot by the
          players<br />
          themselves because the media was not allowed into the Olympic
          Village<br />
          during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is a sequel to Heading Home,<br />
          which documented the exploits of Israel’s baseball squad at the
          2017<br />
          World Baseball Classic in Seoul, South Korea.<br />
          At the Olympics, Israel, the lowest-ranking team, faced five
          opponents<br />
          — the United States, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican<br />
          Republic. “We were the Jamaican bobsled team of baseball,” says one
          of<br />
          the Israelis ruefully but realistically. They faced political<br />
          hostility at their training games in the United States. Palestinian<br />
          women chanted, “Free, free Palestine” and “Long live Palestine.”<br />
          Anti-Zionist haredim held aloft anti-Israel placards. One protester<br />
          likened Israel to an apartheid state. Security was tight at the<br />
          Olympic Village, but the team had no compunction in displaying the<br />
          blue-and-white Israeli flag on the balcony of its living quarters.
          At<br />
          the opening ceremony, a moment of silence was observed for the 11<br />
          Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympics in Munich,
          and<br />
          the players from Israel were clearly touched by this gesture. Yet
          they<br />
          encountered animosity. Some received death threats. Still others
          were<br />
          rebuffed when they sought to exchange athletic pins with some
          athletes<br />
          from certain nations. The film focuses on the games in which the<br />
          Israelis appeared. Much to their disappointment, they won only one<br />
          game. “When you lose, that’s tough,” says one of the players. But
          at<br />
          least they moved into the elimination round, which was no small<br />
          achievement, and enjoyed the privilege of participating in the<br />
          Olympics. Unfortunately, they will not get a second chance to prove<br />
          themselves on the field. Baseball has been eliminated from the 2024<br />
          Olympics, having been replaced by breakdancing.
