            Baseball is not exactly a popular sport in Israel, and few Israelis
            have embraced it. But when the Israeli baseball team qualified for
            the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021, some Israelis tuned in
            and cheered on its players, most of whom were Americans with dual
            U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

            Their quest for a medal — gold, silver or bronze — unfolds in Israel
            Swings for Gold, a well-crafted documentary by Seth Kramer, Daniel
            Miller and Jeremy Newberger which opens in theatres in Florida on
            May 5. Interestingly enough, much of the footage was shot by the
            players themselves because the media was not allowed into the
            Olympic Village during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is a sequel
            to Heading Home, which documented the exploits of Israel’s baseball
            squad at the 2017 World Baseball Classic in Seoul, South Korea. At
            the Olympics, Israel, the lowest-ranking team, faced five opponents
            — the United States, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican
            Republic. “We were the Jamaican bobsled team of baseball,” says one
            of the Israelis ruefully but realistically. They faced political
            hostility at their training games in the United States. Palestinian
            women chanted, “Free, free Palestine” and “Long live Palestine.”
            Anti-Zionist haredim held aloft anti-Israel placards. One protester
            likened Israel to an apartheid state. Security was tight at the
            Olympic Village, but the team had no compunction in displaying the
            blue-and-white Israeli flag on the balcony of its living quarters.
            At the opening ceremony, a moment of silence was observed for the 11
            Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, and
            the players from Israel were clearly touched by this gesture. Yet
            they encountered animosity. Some received death threats. Still
            others were rebuffed when they sought to exchange athletic pins with
            some athletes from certain nations. The film focuses on the games in
            which the Israelis appeared. Much to their disappointment, they won
            only one game. “When you lose, that’s tough,” says one of the
            players. But at least they moved into the elimination round, which
            was no small achievement, and enjoyed the privilege of participating
            in the Olympics. Unfortunately, they will not get a second chance to
            prove themselves on the field. Baseball has been eliminated from the
            2024 Olympics, having been replaced by breakdancing.
