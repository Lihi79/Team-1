        <h3 class="blog__subtitle" id="subtitle">
          Baseball is not exactly a popular sport in Israel, and few Israelis<br />
          have embraced it. But when the Israeli baseball team qualified for
          the<br />
          summer Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021, some Israelis tuned in and<br />
          cheered on its players, most of whom were Americans with dual<br />
          U.S.-Israeli citizenship.

          Their quest for a medal — gold, silver or bronze — unfolds in
          Israel<br />
          Swings for Gold, a well-crafted documentary by Seth Kramer, Daniel<br />
          Miller and Jeremy Newberger which opens in theatres in Florida on
          May<br />
          5. Interestingly enough, much of the footage was shot by the
          players<br />
          themselves because the media was not allowed into the Olympic
          Village<br />
          during the Covid-19 pandemic. The film is a sequel to Heading Home,<br />
          which documented the exploits of Israel’s baseball squad at the
          2017<br />
          World Baseball Classic in Seoul, South Korea.<br />
          At the Olympics, Israel, the lowest-ranking team, faced five
          opponents<br />
          — the United States, Japan, South Korea, Mexico and the Dominican<br />
          Republic. “We were the Jamaican bobsled team of baseball,” says one
          of<br />
          the Israelis ruefully but realistically. They faced political<br />
          hostility at their training games in the United States. Palestinian<br />
          women chanted, “Free, free Palestine” and “Long live Palestine.”<br />
          Anti-Zionist haredim held aloft anti-Israel placards. One protester<br />
          likened Israel to an apartheid state. Security was tight at the<br />
          Olympic Village, but the team had no compunction in displaying the<br />
          blue-and-white Israeli flag on the balcony of its living quarters.
          At<br />
          the opening ceremony, a moment of silence was observed for the 11<br />
          Israeli athletes who were killed at the 1972 Olympics in Munich,
          and<br />
          the players from Israel were clearly touched by this gesture. Yet
          they<br />
          encountered animosity. Some received death threats. Still others
          were<br />
          rebuffed when they sought to exchange athletic pins with some
          athletes<br />
          from certain nations. The film focuses on the games in which the<br />
          Israelis appeared. Much to their disappointment, they won only one<br />
          game. “When you lose, that’s tough,” says one of the players. But
          at<br />
          least they moved into the elimination round, which was no small<br />
          achievement, and enjoyed the privilege of participating in the<br />
          Olympics. Unfortunately, they will not get a second chance to prove<br />
          themselves on the field. Baseball has been eliminated from the 2024<br />
          Olympics, having been replaced by breakdancing.

          Israeli judokas win three medals in <br />

          On Friday, two Israeli judokas brought back medals, where Inbar
          Lanir<br />
          (up to 78 kg division) delivered a great day of fights and won gold<br />
          against all odds, while Peter Paltchik won a bronze medal in the up
          to<br />
          100 kg weight division. This is, therefore, the most successful
          world<br />
          championship in Israel's history and the first time that the<br />
          delegation will return with two medals from the same tournament.<br />
          Lanir began her journey with a judo match against a Polish opponent<br />
          that ended in her victory. In the round of 16, she beat the
          Slovenian<br />
          Patricia Brockli. The big victory of the day for her came in the<br />
          quarter-finals when she beat the Chinese Zhenzhou Ma, the runner-up of
          the world champion.<br />
          In the semi-finals came another huge victory for Lanir, who<br />
          dramatically beat the Italian Alice Blundi, ranked number 1 in the<br />
          world. Blundi beat Lanir in all four previous meetings between them<br />
          and was likely to win this time as well after taking the lead, but
          a<br />
          few seconds before the end of the fight Lanir bounced back, which<br />
          secured her a place in the finals. In the finals, she also
          surprised<br />
          the 33-year-old French judoka Audrey Chomeau, who had previously
          won<br />
          an Olympic silver medal, a gold medal at the World Championships
          and<br />
          four gold medals at the European Championships. Lanir is the tenth<br />
          Israeli to win an individual medal at the World Championships, and
          the<br />
          third to win a gold medal after Yarden Jarbi in 2013 and Shagia
          Muki<br />
          in 2019.<br />
